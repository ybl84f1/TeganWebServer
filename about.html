      <font size=6>About the Tegan Web Server </font><br>
      <font size=3>written by Steve Engelbrecht<br><br>
The Tegan Web Server (TWS) is a basic web server for the Intel Edison platform inspired by Tom Igoe's Arduino
WiFi web server. TWS can be used as a simple web server, as a simple web interface to control Edison's I/O, or as the
basis of an extendable web server application. TWS responds to basic HTTP browser requests for web pages by streaming
out HTML files from the SD storage device and also has the ability to include server-generated data in those pages. TWS'
features include:
<br>
      <ul>
         <li>Pre-built web pages for setting and displaying analog and digital pins.</li>
         <li>Ability to serve standard HTML files by supporting HTTP GET and POST requests from browsers.</li>
         <li>HTML Page Methods and Substitution Tags enabling web pages to include server-generated data.</li>
         <li>Built-in logging capability with support for both HTTP requests and errors.</li>
         <li>HTML file upload capability for easy updating of server web pages from a client.</li>
         <li>Debug setting for dislaying all HTTP incoming and outgoing packets.
         <li>Favicon support</li>
      </ul><br>
      The Tegan Web Server runs in the Arduino environment on the Edison and should be easily portable to both Arduino 
and Galileo. TWS is useful for:
      <ul>
         <li> Displaying and controlling the I/O (digital, analog, PWM) of your Edison.
         <li> Providing a custom web interface to your Edison application.
         <li> Running a simple web server serving simple HTML web pages.
      </ul><br>

      What TWS is not useful for:
      <ul>
         <li> Hosting a high-volume web site.
         <li> Advanced web site services (e.g. SSL, CSS, Java)
         <li> Real-time applications
      </ul>
