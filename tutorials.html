      <font size=6>Tegan Web Server - Tutorials</font><br><br>
      <font size=3>
<p>
<u><font size=5>Tutorial #1 - Networking</font></u><br><br>
For those who's excitment about getting the Tegan Web Server up and running is tempered by a fear
or uncertanty of networking, here are some networking hints that may help get you pointed in the 
right direction in making your TWS visible on your home network and optionally the Internet. Despite
the name this is NOT a tutorial - networking is a big topic far beyond the my scope of knowledge 
however I'll share some simple basics that I've discovered along the way.
<br><br>
<b><u>Some Basics - Know Your IP Address</u></b>
<br><br>
Your IP address is the network address of your device on your home network. It is used to to send 
and receive messages to your computer and is almost always assigned by your home router. IP addresses
have the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, and in most cases start with 192.168.1.xxx where xxx is a unique
number for all your IP devices in your home (computers, printers, Smart TVs, wireless printers, ...) So
your laptop may be 192.168.1.12 and your networked Arduino may be 192.168.1.7. Your devices ask your
router for an IP address when they boot and can get different IP addresses on different days.
<br><br>
Note that your neighbor's laptop may also have the address 192.168.1.12 in their home! How can they
have the same address? Because the IP addresses are only used for your <b><u>local</u></b> home network.
The same addresses are re-used millions of times in other households - it was actually designed this way!
These addresses are not explicitly used for Internet traffic outside the home so there's no problem in 
re-using them. In Windows if you launch the Command Prompt (in Win8 search for "cmd") you can type 
in "ipconfig" and find your laptop's IP address.
<br><br>
<b><u>Accessing TeganWS Inside The Home</u></b>
<br><br>
The IP address of your Arduino or Edison is important since a browser (inside your home) needs to know 
the address of the server to access the TeganWS web pages. Note that if the Tegan web server connects 
successfully to the home network it will record it's IP address in "httplog.txt" file. You will use this 
address instead of the typical URL (www.foobar.com) in the browser to get to the TeganWS.
<br><br>
That IP address will also need a port number added to it, specified in the TeganWS source by "TWSIPPORT" 
which by default is <b>3232</b>. So for instance if your Arduino or Edison's IP address is 192.168.1.5 
then in the browser address bar enter:
<br><br>
<b>192.168.1.5:3232</b>
<br><br>
to get to the main page of the TeganWS.
<br><br>
<b><u>Accessing TeganWS Outside The Home</u></b>
<br><br>
Note that this only works <b><u>within</u></b> the home because your IP address is only valid within your
home network; accessing your TeganWS outside the home takes some more work and is covered in just a moment.
BTW every website in the world uses a 4-octet numeric address! WHAT?...you say...I type in a text URL like
"www.google.com" and not "a 4-octet" xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx number, and I NEVER type in a "port number"! So how does
it work? It works because A) there are servers on the Internet that convert the name "www.google.com" to 
a 4-octet number for you automatically and B) the default port number for web servers is 80 so your browser 
tacks that on to the address for you automatically.
<br><br>
A handy "tool" to have in your toolbox is to be able to log into your home router. Many home routers can be 
reached at "192.168.1.1" - try entering that into your browser (at home) and see if you get a login prompt.
Once logged in most routers allow you to view what IP address are assigned to which devices in your home 
as well as letting you control other settings which may be needed for accessing your Arduino web server 
from outside the home. Look at the documentation that came with your router for how to log into it.
<br><br>
We just mentioned that your Arduino's or Edison's IP address is only valid within the home, so how do you make
your TeganWS visible on the Internet? This is a little more complicated than making it visible inside the home 
and the exact steps will vary depending on several factors but I'll cover the fundamental principle of it. Note 
that you <b>WILL</b> have to be able to log into your router to enable this.
<br><br>
Remember we said the IP address is only valid inside the home? So when your laptop accesses a web site outside 
the home, how does the web site know where to send the return information to? A web server can't return the 
web page to your laptop's IP address of 192.168.1.12 because there are millions of those addresses in millions
of homes!
<br><br>
What happens is when your laptop makes the web page request from www.google.com and uses it's address 
of 192.168.1.12, the request passes through your home router before it goes out to the Internet. Remember the 
router DOES HAVE a unique address on the Internet - say for example it's 281.68.113.414. When the request from 
your laptop passes through the router the router "remembers" the request, adds it's own address to the message
and sends it off to the web site. The web site then sends the return information to the router at 
281.68.113.414, and when the router receives the packet it looks up which device on the home network originally 
sent it (192.168.1.12) and directs it to your laptop. This router service is called <b>Network Address Traversal 
(NAT)</b>. 
<br><br>
But things are different when the web server is inside your home and you're accessing it from outside the home. 
Using the above example, if you're outside your home you can't request data from 281.68.113.414 because that's 
your router and your router has no idea which of your many home devices (your laptop, Smart TV, Arduino, etc) to 
pass the request on to! And you can't request data from 192.168.1.12 because that is the address of millions 
of other devices in millions of other homes (not to mention that it is a local in-home address and not visible 
anywhere on the Internet!) The problem is that NAT only works when the web page request goes from inside the 
home to outside, but not the other way around. However, there is a solution that works the other way around - 
it's called <b>Port Forwarding</b>.
<br><br>
Remember that Port number (TeganWS default is 3232) that we used inside the home? We can use that and your
router's <b>Port Forwarding</b> service to make your web server available from outside your home. You will need 4 
things to make this happen:
<br>
<ul>
<li> You need to be able to log into your router,
<li> You need to know the public Internet IP address of your router,
<li> You need to enable <b>Port Forwarding</b> in your router, and
<li> You will need to know the IP address of your Arduino.
</ul>
So <b>Port Forwarding</b> works something like this: You configure your router to link a specified Port number, 
say "3232", to an "inside-the-home" IP address, say "192.168.1.7". Now any request <b>to your router</b> at 
(using the above example) 281.68.113.414:<b>3232</b> (note the appended port number) will be serviced not by your 
router but instead will be "port forwarded" and passed on to the device at the local IP address of 192.168.1.7, 
which is your web server! <b>Port Forwarding</b> links a request with a specific Port number to an in-the-home 
IP address so requests from outside the home can access devices inside the home.
<br><br>
To get the public IP address of your router, log into it and check out the main page or the page that shows the 
connection parameters to your ISP's modem device. How exactly to find this information is very different on 
different routers so unfortunately I can't provide more guidance than what is here. It will be a 4-octet IP
address and <b>will not be</b> 192.xxx.xxx.xxx.
<br><br>
When logged into the router you will also need to find where to configure Port Forwarding. The service will 
typically ask you for A) the IP address you want to forward to (which is the IP address of your Arduino running 
TeganWS) and B) the Port number (which defaults to "3232" in the TeganWS software).
<br><br>
One last note - remember that "inside-the-home" IP addresses (usually 192.168.1.xxx) get assigned when devices 
boot and can stay the same for months or change often. If they change then this can be an issue with Port 
Forwarding since you have to specify the IP address to forward to. So if you are able to access your TeganWS 
one day and not the next, the Arduino's IP address may have changed. However your router has a solution to this 
also! It can "lock" a certain IP address to a certain device; this is usually called something like "Address 
Reservation" where you select the device and the IP address (for example 192.168.1.7) and bind them together. 
This will prevent your Arduino's IP address from ever changing and not being accesible.

<u><font size=5>Tutorial #2 - Making A Simple Web Page</font></u><br><br>
<br>
In this tutorial we create a simple web page and link to it from the existing "playground.html" page. The basic
steps are:
<br><ul>
<li> Use a text editor to create a simple "Hello World" HTML web page.
<li> Upload the page to the Edison SD Card.
</ul>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: In order to display HTML tags in this tutorial without them being rendered on this page all tags 
will have a "<b>.</b>" following the first character "<" of the tag. The period after the angle bracket disables 
the tag. For example the HTML tag for <b>font size</b> is written here as <b>"<.font size = 5>"</b> so that it 
doesn't affect THIS page that you're reading now. Simply copy and paste the HTML code below and <u>remove the first 
period after the "<" on each tag</u>.
<br><br>
<b>1)</b> Using a text editor on your PC - one that can save in a text-only format like Windows Notepad - create 
the following file named "helloworld.html". Note the all lowercase spelling and ".html" extension.
<br><br>
<.!DOCTYPE html><br>
<.html><br>
<.head><br>
  <.title>helloworld.html<./title><br>
<./head><br>
<.body bgcolor="#E6E6FA"><br>
<.p><.font size=6><.center>Hello World!<./center><./font><./p><.br><.br><.br><br>
<.br><.br><.br><.a href="/ ">Home Page<./a><br>
<./body><br>
<./html><br>
<br>
<b>2)<font size=3> REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "." THAT FOLLOWS EACH "<" !!!</font></b> Also ensure that there is
a space after the "/" in the "href="/ " tag.
<br>
<br>
<b>3)</b> You can test the file by opening it with a browser, either by using "File/Open" or double-clicking 
on it in you file manager. You should see a colored page with a big "Hello World" near the top and centered. Note 
that the "Home Page" link may not work correctly - that's okay right now.
<br><br>
<b>4)</b> At this point we want to get your file "helloworld.html" onto the Edison SD Card. There are several
ways to do this:
<br>
<ul>
<li> Go to the Home Page of the TWS web server and select "Uploads". After selecting the "helloworld.html" file 
click on the "Submit" button. Note the screen will not change during uploading - BE PATIENT! Upon successful 
upload you will be brought back to the TWS Home Page. If it fails it should be noted in the error log; try one 
of the next methods.
<br><br>
<li> Use a SSH utility with file transfer capability such as Bitvise and upload the file to the SD Card root directory.
<br><br>
<li> Power down the Edison and use an SD card reader to copy the file.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> Once your file is uploaded, go to the "Playground" link off the main page. You will see a link to
"Hello World" which up until now was a dead link. Clicking on it will take you to your new page! If you 
get a "404" error hit the back button, hover your mouse over the link and make sure the filename displayed 
matches your filename exactly, and that your file is in the root directory of the SD Card.
<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> that several browsers like MS Internet Explorer and Google Chrome have the ability to show the HTML 
code of a web page. This can be handy to see what is actually being sent to your browser. For instance, in 
Chrome go to Options/More Tools/View Source to see the HTML for the page that you are on.

<u><font size=5>Tutorial #3 - Simple Web Page with PIN TAG</font></u><br><br>
In this tutorial we take what we learned in Tutorial #2 and add a Substitute Pin tag. If you have any inputs
configured to a digital or analog input, go ahead and use them, otherwise we'll just read one of the analog
in pins.
<br><br>
The basic steps are:
<br><ul>
<li> Use a text editor to create a simple "foobar.html" page similar to "helloworld.html".<br>
<li> Add the Substitute Pin tags
<li> Upload the page to the Edison SD Card.
</ul>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Create a new file called "foobar.html" by making a copy of your "helloworld.html" file and call it 
"foobar.html". Replace the text "Hello World" with "Hello Foobar" and change the <.title> to "foobar.html".
<br><br>
<b>2)</b> Add a new line after the "Hello Foobar" line and add the following tags (without the "."):
<br>
<.br><.br>Analog Input Pin 0 = <.%SPAIP0><br>
<.br><.br>Digital Input Pin 3 = <.%SPDIP3><br>
<br>
(There is already a link on "playground.html" for "foobar.html").
<br><br>
<b>3)</b> Upload the file as described in Tutorial #2. Once your file is uploaded, go to the "Playground" 
link off the main page. You will see a link to "foobar.html" which up until now was a dead link. Clicking on 
it will take you to your new page! Notice the Substitution Tags have been replaced with readings.
<br><br><br>
</p>
<p>
<u><font size=5>Tutorial #4 - Simple Web Page with a LIST TAG and PAGE METHOD</font></u><br><br>
In this last tutorial we pull out all the stops and create a Page Method to perform a calculation and use 
a Substitute List tag to display it. The basic steps of this tutorial are:
<br><ul>
<li> Create a Method that generates a random number and two substitution strings.
<li> Create a HTML web page that includes Substitution List Tags.
<li> Modify the TeganWS to link the new Method to the new web page
</ul>
<br>
For this exercise you will have to modify the TeganWS code in a few places, so fire up your Arduino IDE 
and locate the following in the code:
<br><ul>
<li> The declaration "char substitute_data[5][MAXSUBCOL];" at the beginning of the file,
<li> The declaration "void http_verb_get(char URL[])" about halfway through the file, and
<li> Find "void environmentalhtml()" because we'll put our new Method right after that.
</ul>
<br><br>
The following Method will generate a random number and generate a string that indicates whether it's odd 
or even. Add the following after "environmentalhtml()":
<br><br> <b>
void oddorevenhtml() {<br>
  long i;<br>
  i = random(100);<br>
  sprintf(&substitute_data[0][0], "%d", i);<br>
  if ((i % 2) == 0) {<br>
    strncpy(&substitute_data[1][0], "even", 5);<br>
  } else strncpy(&substitute_data[1][0], "odd", 4);<br>
  stream_html_file("oddoreven.html");<br>
  return;<br>
}</b><br>
<br>
Note the global array "substitute_data[5][MAXSUBCOL]" is a global 2 dimensional char array and you must 
be careful of a few things:
<br><ul>
<li> The number of strings cannot exceed the first array dimension, in this case 6 (0 - 5). Of course you can 
always change this.
<li> The number of characters in each string must not exceed "MAXSUBCOL" and must be null ('\0') terminated.
</ul>
Also note that there is a procedure call you must make at the end of your Method. You must call 
"<b>stream_html_file("oddoreven.html");</b>" with the name of your HTML web page.
<br><br>
Next - let's create an HTML web page to display the random number. <b>(REMEMBER to remove the "." after 
each "<")</b>:
<br><br><b>
<.!DOCTYPE html><br>
<.html><br>
<.head><br>
  <.title>oddoreven.html<./title><br>
<./head><br>
<.body bgcolor="#E6E6FA"><br>
  <.p><.font size=6><.center>Tegan Web Server<./center><./font><./p><br>
<.br><br>
  The random number <.%SL0> is <.%SL1>.<br>
  <.br><.br><.br><.br><.br><.a href="/ ">Home Page<./a><br>
  <.br><.br><.br>*This web site powered by a single Intel Edison computer!<.br><br>
<./body><br>
<./html></b><br>
<br><br>
Now all we have to do is link the "<b>oddoreven.html</b>" web page to the "<b>oddorevenhtml()</b>" method and 
we'll be all set. Look in the program for "<b>void http_verb_get</b>" and do the following:
<ul>
<li> Look for the declaration "<b>const char *htmllist[6];</b>" and increase the 6 to 7;
<li> The htmllist[5] should read: htmllist[5] = "oddoreven.html";
<li> The htmllist[6] should read: htmllist[6] = NULL;
<li> Go down just a bit and find "switch (k)" and add
<br><br><b>
      case 5:<br>
      oddorevenhtml();<br>
      break;</b><br>
</ul>
<br>
Note the index into <b>htmllist</b> (in this example '5') <b><u>MUST MATCH</u></b> the <b>case</b> statement.
<br><br>
With these steps you have added the actual filename to look for and linked it to the Method used to process 
the data. Now load the new code into your Arduino and use the "Upload" feature to upload your new 
"oddoreven.html" web page to the Tegan Web Server. You should now be able to go to the Playground and 
see your new page in action! Keep hitting "refresh" on your browser to see the number change.
<br><br>
So let's review what we've done:
<br><ul>
<li> You created a Method which calculated a random number, converted that number to a string and copied that 
string to the 0th index of the substitution_data array, which corresponds to List Tag <.%SL0>.
<li> Your code determines if the random number is odd or even and copies the appropriate string ("odd" or 
"even") into the 1st index of the substitution_data array which corresponds to List Tag <.%SL1>
<li> The web page prints out the number using Substitution List Tag <.%SL0> followed by the next List 
Tag <.%SL1) which been replaced with either the string "odd" or "even".
<li> You linked the Method to the web page name in "<b>void http_verb_get(char URL[])</b>" so when that page 
is requested it calls your Method.
</ul>

<br><br>
Lastly, if your Method needs access to the parameters passed in the HTTP "GET" command take a look at 
the function "<b>iocontrolhtml(char httpparams[])</b>" and how it is called from "<b>void http_verb_get</b>". 
The passed parameter "<b>char httpparams[]</b>" is a null-terminated character array that contains the 
URL string starting with any characters after '?'. For instance, on the I/O Control Page if you set Pin 13 to 
"LOW" the URL passed to TeganWS is "<b>XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:YYYY/iocontrol.html?D13=L</b>". This allows your Method 
to receive and parse a URL with passed parameters.
