<u><font size=5>Tutorial #1 - Networking</font></u><br><br>
For those who's excitment about getting the Tegan Web Server up and running is tempered by a fear
or uncertanty of networking, here are some networking hints that may help get you pointed in the 
right direction in making your TWS visible on your home network and optionally the Internet. This 
is NOT a tutorial - networking is a big topic far beyond the my scope of my knowledge however I'll 
share some simple basics that I've discovered along the way.
<br><br>
I will call out the things in this section that are unique to the Edison that you may not find on
an Arduino board.

<u><font size=5>Tutorial #2 - Making A Simple Web Page</font></u><br><br>
<br>
In this tutorial we create a simple web page and link to it from the existing "playground.html" page. The basic
steps are:
<br><ul>
<li> Use a text editor to create a simple "Hello World" page.
<li> Upload the page to the Edison SD Card.
</ul>
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: In order to display HTML tags in this tutorial without them being rendered on this page all tags 
will have a "<b>.</b>" following the first character "<" of the tag. The period after the angle bracket kills
the tag. For example the HTML tag for <b>font size</b> is written here as <b>"<.font size = 5>"</b> so that it 
doesn't affect THIS page that you're reading now. Simply copy and paste the HTML code below and <u>remove the first 
period after the "<" on each tag</u>.
<br><br>
<b>1)</b> Using a text editor on your PC - one that can save in a text-only format like Windows Notepad - create 
the following file named "helloworld.html". Note the all lowercase spelling and ".html" extension.
<br><br>
<.!DOCTYPE html><br>
<.html><br>
<.head><br>
  <.title>helloworld.html<./title><br>
<./head><br>
<.body bgcolor="#E6E6FA"><br>
<.p><.font size=6><.center>Hello World!<./center><./font><./p><.br><.br><.br><br>
<.br><.br><.br><.a href="/ ">Home Page<./a><br>
<./body><br>
<./html><br>
<br>
<b>2)<font size=4> REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE "." THAT FOLLOWS EACH "<" !!!</font></b> Also ensure that there is
a space after the "/" in the "href="/ " tag.
<br>
<br>
<b>3)</b> Test the file by opening it with a browser. You should see a colored page with a big "Hello World" 
near the top and centered. Note that the "Home Page" link may not work correctly - that's okay.
<br><br>
<b>4)</b> At this point we want to get your file "helloworld.html" onto the Edison SD Card. There are several
ways to do this:
<br>
<ul>
<li> Go to the Home Page of the TWS web server and select "Uploads". After selecting the "helloworld.html" file 
click on the "Submit" button. Note the screen will not change during uploading - BE PATIENT! Upon successful 
upload you will be brought back to the TWS Home Page. If it fails it should be noted in the error log; try one 
of the next methods.
<br><br>
<li> Use a SSH utility with file transfer capability such as Bitvise and upload the file to the SD Card root directory.
<br><br>
<li> Power down the Edison and use an SD card reader to copy the file.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>5)</b> Once your file is uploaded, go to the "Playground" link off the main page. You will see a link to
"Hello World" which up until now was a dead link. Clicking on it will take you to your new page! If you 
get a "404" error hit the back button, hover your mouse over the link and make sure the filename displayed 
matches your filename exactly, and that your file is in the root directory of the SD Card.

*** NOTE THE USE OF BROWSER VIEW SOURCE but not with substitution tags

<u><font size=5>Tutorial #3 - Simple Web Page with PIN TAG</font></u><br><br>
In this tutorial we take what we learned in Tutorial #2 and add a Substitute Pin tag. If you have any inputs
configured to a digital or analog input, go ahead and use them, otherwise we'll just read one of the analog
in pins.
<br>
The basic steps are:
<br><ul>
<li> Use a text editor to create a simple "foobar.html" page similar to "helloworld.html".<br>
<li> Add the Substitute Pin tags
<li> Upload the page to the Edison SD Card.
</ul>
<br>
<b>1)</b> Create a new file called "foobar.html" by making a copy of your "helloworld.html" file and call it 
"foobar.html". Replace the text "Hello World" with "Hello Foobar" and change the <.title> to "foobar.html".
<br><br>
<b>2)</b> Add a new line after the "Hello Foobar" line and add the following tags (without the "."):
<br>
<.br><.br>Analog Input Pin 0 = <.%SPAIP0><br>
<.br><.br>Digital Input Pin 3 = <.%SPDIP3><br>
<br>
(There is already a link on "playground.html" for "foobar.html").
<br><br>
<b>3)</b> Upload the file as described in Tutorial #2. Once your file is uploaded, go to the "Playground" 
link off the main page. You will see a link to "foobar.html" which up until now was a dead link. Clicking on 
it will take you to your new page! Notice the Substitution Tags have been replaced with readings.
